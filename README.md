# URL Shortener Microservice

This is the 3rd project for the FCC Back End certification following requirements at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice. Boilerplate code for the basic node app as well as the UI is provided. Connection to the MongoDB database (hosted on Atlas) and all CRUD operations as well as GET and POST requests is handled by code I've written. The specific solution to have a counter incrementing as entries in the database are added, that is then used as the number for the short url as an index follows https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GkujEyjJm8. If you have found an easier solution to implement the same thing I'd be curious to hear about it. This project is hosted on https://url-shortener-9m8m.onrender.com.
